***awesome-msdf*** is a collection of various *glsl shaders* utilizing **MSDF (multi-channel signed distance fields)** to render text in high quality while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated* in 3D space. It shows the basic usage of MSDF in text rendering with some additional, more advanced text modifiers.

All assets and characters were generated by the [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) utility. Options to create the character assets were MTSDF (multi-channel *true* signed distance field) type with distance field pixel range of 6.

For *2D rendering*, you are better off using a rasterizer since there are no constant text size or rotation modifications, unlike in 3D rendering.

**Remember to** generate a texture atlas with [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen) utility and **not to** generate every character texture separately, as shown in the examples. The utility can also output an *arfont* file containing all character atlas positions, kerning info, spaces between characters and more.

## Shaders, tips and *real-time* output

> Read through the README in the [shaders](./shaders) folder for more detailed shader explanations and a few tips.

To see how the shaders work in real-time, you can download the [**SHADERed**](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/releases) desktop application, open the ***'.sprj'*** file from the repo with the *SHADERed app* and see the output on the canvas. Learn more about *SHADERed* on their official [Tutorial website](https://shadered.org/docs/tutorials.html) or by watching [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0EO-cKorzRAEfwHoJFiIldiyiyDR3-2).

## Basic MSDF usage

The following snippet shows the basic usage of an MSDF texture (*distance field pixel range 6*) to render text while preserving the highest quality. For more info, check out this [explanation](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen#using-a-multi-channel-distance-field) from the msdfgen creator.

```glsl
uniform sampler2D tex;

in vec2 uvCoord;
out vec4 outColor;

float median(float r, float g, float b) {
    return max(min(r, g), min(max(r, g), b));
}

float screenPxRange() {
    vec2 unitRange = vec2(6.0) / vec2(textureSize(tex, 0));
    vec2 screenTexSize = vec2(1.0) / fwidth(uvCoord);
    return max(0.5 * dot(unitRange, screenTexSize), 1.0);
}

void main() {
    vec4 texel = texture(tex, uvCoord);
    float dist = median(texel.r, texel.g, texel.b);

    float pxDist = screenPxRange() * (dist - 0.5);
    float opacity = clamp(pxDist + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);

    outColor = vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, opacity);
}
```

## The repo motive

There are two reasons why I wanted to make this repo. The first reason is that I am very interested in distance fields and their usage in rendering. Therefore, this repo helps me to understand and learn more. The second reason is the rare findings on this topic over the internet. While searching for code examples and usage information regarding the subject, I could only find a few articles. Also, searching on GitHub, I often found the same basic *code snippet* repeating itself in almost every repo. I want to fill this repo with as much information and code examples (basic to advanced) as possible so other people don't have to search aimlessly.

## Contributing and questions

All contributions, such as fixing grammar, adding new sources and improving shader code, are welcome.
